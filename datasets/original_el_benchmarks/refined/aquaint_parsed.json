Botha   would be put on trial for abuses committed during  white rule  . \n\n Prosecutor Jan D'Oliveira said he currently has insufficient evidence to prosecute Botha, but that information collected by the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)  , which investigated apartheid-era abuses, still must be evaluated to ascertain whether charges would ultimately be brought. \n\n Last month, the Truth Comission issued a landmark report on its findings. It said Botha had ordered the 1987 bombing of the  African National Congress  ' London headquarters and the 1988 bombing of a  Johannesburg   building housing an anti-apartheid group. \n\n When Botha was head of state in the 1980s, thousands of people were detained without trial. Many were tortured and others killed. \n\n The commission can grant  amnesty   to those who fully confess to politically motivated abuses committed during apartheid. Botha has said he has nothing to confess and has not sought amnesty. \n\n Earlier this year, Botha was convicted of  contempt of court   for refusing to testify before the commission. He was handed a suspended one-year jail sentence and a 10,000  rand  (dlrs 5,700) fine.

The area is about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage. \n\n \n\n The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday. \n\n \n\n His only visible wound was a single bite to the head, said Bruce Bartley, a spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife Conservation. \n\n \n\n State and federal wildlife officials were looking for the bear involved in the attack. If the bear is judged to pose a continuing threat to humans it may be killed. \n\n \n\n Troopers said Cates' .280-caliber  rifle   and two spent shell casings were found near the body, along with traces of blood that suggest that Cates may have wounded the animal. \n\n \n\n \"We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if there were two real shots,'' Bartley said. \n\n \n\n Cates' death is the first fatal bear mauling in Alaska since Feb. 8, 1998, when  Audelio Luis Cortes  , 40, was killed while working on a  seismic   crew in the  Swanson River    oil field   near  Kenai . Cortes also died from a single head bite. \n\n", "mentions": [{"text": "Kenai", "wiki_name": "Kenai, Alaska", "start": 1331, "length": 5}]}

They spoke on customary condition of anonymity. \n\n The art works, Claude Monet's 1897 painting \"The Cliffs of Dieppe'' and  Alfred Sisley  's 1890 work \"The Alley of the Poplars,'' were found on a sail boat anchored in the small  Riviera   port of  Saint Laurent du Var , police said. \n\n The police sources said that curator Jean Forneris is suspected of having ordered the theft. \n\n The paintings were stolen by two masked men who took Forneris from his home, drove him to the museum, then bound and gagged him, the caretaker and another employee and shut them in the museum library. \n\n The museum alarm had been turned off, allegedly because the caretaker was on duty. The two men sped off in the curator's car with the paintings. \n\n Forneris later expressed his \"shock'' at the thefts. \n\n (eg-parf) \n\n", "mentions": [{"text": "Saint Laurent du Var", "wiki_name": "Saint-Laurent-du-Var", "start": 755, "length": 20}]}

It also raised fears of  copycat   attacks. \n\n Lab tests on the tea revealed traces of  sodium azide  , a chemical used in many industrial products, including  air-bag   mechanisms, said police spokesman Masashi Toma. \n\n The victims of the poisoning were in stable condition, but three suffered mild  liver disorders   Tuesday, said Yasuo Hirose, an official at the  Niigata City   Hospital. \n\n The  March 1995    nerve gas   attack on Tokyo subways carried out by the  Aum Shinri Kyo  religious cult has made Japan particularly wary of poisoning incidents.
