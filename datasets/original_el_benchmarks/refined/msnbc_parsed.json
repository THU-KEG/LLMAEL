A Home Depot spokesman said the timing of the resignation, which was effective Tuesday, had no bearing on the amount in the package.\nThe total package is seven times the $30 million Home Depot set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service.

That director, Bonnie Hill, did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in Los Angeles.\nAsked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot, Nardelli said unequivocally that he hadn't.

But in the end, analysts said, the criticism over Nardelli's hefty pay and The Home Depot Inc.'s poor stock performance forced a change of heart.\nNardelli abruptly resigned as chairman and chief executive of the world's largest home improvement store chain after six years at the helm, the company said Wednesday.\nHe didn't leave empty-handed: the Atlanta-based company said Nardelli would receive a severance package worth roughly $210 million, an amount decried by some lawmakers as a golden parachute that sends the wrong message to investors.\n\"It's a sign of being totally out of touch,\" said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. \"They don't understand the extent to which they make the American public angry.\"\nFrank said he would push for legislation requiring public companies to allow shareholders to have a say in compensation and severance for senior executives. At Home Depot's annual meeting last May, shareholder proposals to give investors a say on the CEO's pay and to restrict retirement benefits for senior executives were rejected.\nNardelli's severance package includes a cash payment of $20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $77 million. A Home Depot spokesman said the timing of the resignation, which was effective Tuesday, had no bearing on the amount in the package.\nThe total package is seven times the $30 million Home Depot set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service. Home Depot has 2,127 stores and 355,000 employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.\nHome Depot said Nardelli was being replaced by Frank Blake, its vice chairman, effective immediately.\nHome Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, who had a hand in hiring Nardelli, said he supports the board's decision to replace Nardelli with Blake.\n\"My concern is what happens in the future, and I feel very good about it,\" said Marcus, who no longer works for Home Depot in any official capacity but remains one of the company's largest individual shareholders.\nAsked about the severance payout, Marcus said the amount won't be that big a deal in the long-run if the company's stock price improves.\n\"It's like the old story, if the stock goes up 10 points, who's going to care?\" Marcus said.\nNardelli, a former college football player, became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at General Electric Co., where Nardelli had been a senior executive.\nBlake's appointment is permanent, Home Depot spokesman Jerry Shields said. The company declined to make Blake available for comment, and messages left for Nardelli with his secretary and on his wife's cell phone were not immediately returned.\nHome Depot shares rose 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $41.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, near the upper end of their 52-week range of $32.85 to $43.95. Before Wednesday's news, Home Depot's stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over.\nNardelli's sudden departure was stunning in that he told The Associated Press as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors. That director, Bonnie Hill, did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in Los Angeles.\nAsked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot, Nardelli said unequivocally that he hadn't. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, Nardelli said, \"Selling hammers.\"\nFor The Home Depot?\n\"Absolutely,\" he said at the time.\nMarcus said he had no idea Nardelli's resignation was coming.\n\"Obviously, something happened over this last period of time that changed their mind and Nardelli's mind about staying,\" Marcus said.\nHome Depot said Nardelli's decision to resign was by mutual agreement with Home Depot.\n\"We are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of The Home Depot over the past six years,\" Home Depot's board said in a statement.\nNardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader. He helped increase revenue and profits at Home Depot and increase the number of stores the company operates. Home Depot's earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the public discussion about his pay and the company's stock price became a distraction.\nAs of the end of 2005, Nardelli had earned $123.7 million in compensation excluding certain stock option grants since becoming CEO. His compensation for 2006 has not yet been disclosed.\nIndustry experts and analysts said his departure and Blake's ascent to the top job are a good thing for Home Depot.\n\"This is not about strategy or vision,\" said James Senn, director of Robinson College's Center for Global Business Leadership at Georgia State University. \"This is coming down to two things. Really the foundation of leadership is credibility. Bob has run into some problems there. The second is execution.\"\nEdward Jones analyst Stephanie Hoff said she views the developments at Home Depot as a sign that there was a need for change at the top, not a change in the company's strategy.\n\"I think his gruff demeanor, while some people would consider that refreshing, sometimes hurt him,\" Hoff said, adding that Blake is considered by some as more articulate and polished.\nShe added, \"I think the board basically was looking at this situation and figured Nardelli had become such a lightning rod for criticism of his pay package.\"\n", "mentions": [{"text": "Mexico", "wiki_name": "Mexico", "start": 1836, "length": 6}]}

But in the end, analysts said, the criticism over Nardelli's hefty pay and The Home Depot Inc.'s poor stock performance forced a change of heart.\nNardelli abruptly resigned as chairman and chief executive of the world's largest home improvement store chain after six years at the helm, the company said Wednesday.\nHe didn't leave empty-handed: the Atlanta-based company said Nardelli would receive a severance package worth roughly $210 million, an amount decried by some lawmakers as a golden parachute that sends the wrong message to investors.\n\"It's a sign of being totally out of touch,\" said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. \"They don't understand the extent to which they make the American public angry.\"\nFrank said he would push for legislation requiring public companies to allow shareholders to have a say in compensation and severance for senior executives. At Home Depot's annual meeting last May, shareholder proposals to give investors a say on the CEO's pay and to restrict retirement benefits for senior executives were rejected.\nNardelli's severance package includes a cash payment of $20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $77 million. A Home Depot spokesman said the timing of the resignation, which was effective Tuesday, had no bearing on the amount in the package.\nThe total package is seven times the $30 million Home Depot set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service. Home Depot has 2,127 stores and 355,000 employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.\nHome Depot said Nardelli was being replaced by Frank Blake, its vice chairman, effective immediately.\nHome Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, who had a hand in hiring Nardelli, said he supports the board's decision to replace Nardelli with Blake.\n\"My concern is what happens in the future, and I feel very good about it,\" said Marcus, who no longer works for Home Depot in any official capacity but remains one of the company's largest individual shareholders.\nAsked about the severance payout, Marcus said the amount won't be that big a deal in the long-run if the company's stock price improves.\n\"It's like the old story, if the stock goes up 10 points, who's going to care?\" Marcus said.\nNardelli, a former college football player, became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at General Electric Co., where Nardelli had been a senior executive.\nBlake's appointment is permanent, Home Depot spokesman Jerry Shields said. The company declined to make Blake available for comment, and messages left for Nardelli with his secretary and on his wife's cell phone were not immediately returned.\nHome Depot shares rose 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $41.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, near the upper end of their 52-week range of $32.85 to $43.95. Before Wednesday's news, Home Depot's stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over.\nNardelli's sudden departure was stunning in that he told The Associated Press as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors. That director, Bonnie Hill, did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in Los Angeles.\nAsked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot, Nardelli said unequivocally that he hadn't. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, Nardelli said, \"Selling hammers.\"\nFor The Home Depot?\n\"Absolutely,\" he said at the time.\nMarcus said he had no idea Nardelli's resignation was coming.\n\"Obviously, something happened over this last period of time that changed their mind and Nardelli's mind about staying,\" Marcus said.\nHome Depot said Nardelli's decision to resign was by mutual agreement with Home Depot.\n\"We are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of The Home Depot over the past six years,\" Home Depot's board said in a statement.\nNardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader. He helped increase revenue and profits at Home Depot and increase the number of stores the company operates. Home Depot's earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the public discussion about his pay and the company's stock price became a distraction.\nAs of the end of 2005, Nardelli had earned $123.7 million in compensation excluding certain stock option grants since becoming CEO. His compensation for 2006 has not yet been disclosed.\nIndustry experts and analysts said his departure and Blake's ascent to the top job are a good thing for Home Depot.\n\"This is not about strategy or vision,\" said James Senn, director of Robinson College's Center for Global Business Leadership at Georgia State University. \"This is coming down to two things.

But in the end, analysts said, the criticism over Nardelli's hefty pay and The Home Depot Inc.'s poor stock performance forced a change of heart.\nNardelli abruptly resigned as chairman and chief executive of the world's largest home improvement store chain after six years at the helm, the company said Wednesday.\nHe didn't leave empty-handed: the Atlanta-based company said Nardelli would receive a severance package worth roughly $210 million, an amount decried by some lawmakers as a golden parachute that sends the wrong message to investors.\n\"It's a sign of being totally out of touch,\" said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. \"They don't understand the extent to which they make the American public angry.\"\nFrank said he would push for legislation requiring public companies to allow shareholders to have a say in compensation and severance for senior executives. At Home Depot's annual meeting last May, shareholder proposals to give investors a say on the CEO's pay and to restrict retirement benefits for senior executives were rejected.\nNardelli's severance package includes a cash payment of $20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $77 million. A Home Depot spokesman said the timing of the resignation, which was effective Tuesday, had no bearing on the amount in the package.\nThe total package is seven times the $30 million Home Depot set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service. Home Depot has 2,127 stores and 355,000 employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China.\nHome Depot said Nardelli was being replaced by Frank Blake, its vice chairman, effective immediately.\nHome Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, who had a hand in hiring Nardelli, said he supports the board's decision to replace Nardelli with Blake.\n\"My concern is what happens in the future, and I feel very good about it,\" said Marcus, who no longer works for Home Depot in any official capacity but remains one of the company's largest individual shareholders.\nAsked about the severance payout, Marcus said the amount won't be that big a deal in the long-run if the company's stock price improves.\n\"It's like the old story, if the stock goes up 10 points, who's going to care?\" Marcus said.\nNardelli, a former college football player, became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at General Electric Co., where Nardelli had been a senior executive.\nBlake's appointment is permanent, Home Depot spokesman Jerry Shields said. The company declined to make Blake available for comment, and messages left for Nardelli with his secretary and on his wife's cell phone were not immediately returned.\nHome Depot shares rose 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $41.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, near the upper end of their 52-week range of $32.85 to $43.95. Before Wednesday's news, Home Depot's stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over.\nNardelli's sudden departure was stunning in that he told The Associated Press as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors. That director, Bonnie Hill, did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in Los Angeles.\nAsked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot, Nardelli said unequivocally that he hadn't. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, Nardelli said, \"Selling hammers.\"\nFor The Home Depot?\n\"Absolutely,\" he said at the time.\nMarcus said he had no idea Nardelli's resignation was coming.\n\"Obviously, something happened over this last period of time that changed their mind and Nardelli's mind about staying,\" Marcus said.\nHome Depot said Nardelli's decision to resign was by mutual agreement with Home Depot.\n\"We are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of The Home Depot over the past six years,\" Home Depot's board said in a statement.\nNardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader. He helped increase revenue and profits at Home Depot and increase the number of stores the company operates. Home Depot's earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years.

Several of his casino companies have filed for business bankruptcies. They are out of bankruptcy now,\"' Walters said.\nIn a phone interview with The Associated Press, Trump said he appreciated that Walters \"did a retraction\" and claimed the show's \"ratings are up because of people like me.\"\n\"Barbara fully understands what Barbara told me,\" he said. \"At the same time, she can't say that because she has to work with the woman.

Many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children.\n\"The problem of the uninsured is getting worse,\" and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004, said Jennifer Tolbert, principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a Washington-based think tank.\nTolbert said it was possible the U.S. Congress could increase the scope of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year.\nIn the lurch\nChildren with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost.\nThen the child's illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to nurse the child back to health.\nIn Alabama, there were 230,000 uninsured children in 1988, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the Child Caring Foundation and state programs.\nJody Sharp, 60, is an example of the problem the charity aims to address.\nShe and her husband adopted a foster child, Dana, from a mother who was mentally handicapped. Later, they adopted Dana's brother Kyle who has epilepsy and asthma.\nBut Sharp's husband, the family wage earner, walked out in 1990, leaving Sharp to bring up the two children with no health insurance.\n\"If you never had a child with epilepsy, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no insurance, it's thousands of dollars just like that,\" Sharp told Reuters.\nDuring their two years in the Alabama Blue Cross Blue Shield program, Sharp's children received free medical care and she found a job working with special needs children. The money saved helped her move into private health insurance.\nSome 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private health insurance within about 30 months.\n\"All of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of insurance so you don't have to worry about squeezing doctor bills out of an already stretched paycheck,\" said Sharp.\nBear's eye\nTo recruit families, Rohling tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing and elsewhere.\nAt one recent presentation, a student nurse pulled a teddy bear eye out of a child's ear, ending three years of one-sided deafness. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don't have health insurance.\nLow cost health insurance for low income American children began in Pittsburgh in 1985 when Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania insured children of laid-off steel workers.

Many consumers believe they're buying the right type of bread but are often confused. According to a Sara Lee Food & Beverage survey, 73% of consumers who were asked what type of bread they had in the house said \"whole wheat bread,\" but after checking the label realized that they mistakenly thought \"enriched wheat\" meant whole grain.\nLook a \"whole\" lot closer at labels in the bread aisle - it must say 100% Whole Wheat or 100% Whole Grain, or list the word WHOLE as one of the first ingredients on the label.\n5.\u00a0Slow the pace - lose fat on your waist\nIn an interesting experiment that was presented at the 2006 Annual Scientific Meeting a NAASO, women were invited to eat a pasta lunch on two different days. On one day, the women were given a small spoon and asked to take small bites, put the spoon down between bites, and chew each bite at least 15 times. On the second day, the women were given a large spoon and asked to eat as quickly as possible without stopping between bites. On both occasions, the women ate until they felt comfortably full. When researchers measured how many calories the women ate, they found that women ate 67 more calories when they ate quickly than when they ate slowly. Although this may not sound like much, calories add up.\nAn additional 134 calories per day, means 48,910 calories per year\u2026. that's potentially 14 pounds (lost or gained!).\nFor more information on healthy eating, visit nutrition expert, Joy Bauer's website at www.joybauernutrition.com\n", "mentions": [{"text": "Joy Bauer", "wiki_name": "Joy Bauer", "start": 3229, "length": 9}]}

More than five years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, exposed severe weaknesses in the ability of emergency workers to communicate with each other, the report gave only six of the areas studied the highest grades.\nPortions of the report had been obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.\n'Longstanding cultural differences' Chertoff said Wednesday that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, agencies have tried to overcome old turf rivalries that can hamper emergency work.\n\"In some communities, not all, there are some longstanding cultural differences between different kinds of responders,\" including police, firefighters and medical personnel, Chertoff said. \"I think that is a challenge and that culture has been a challenge.\"\nThe report found that while emergency agencies in more than 60 percent of the communities studied had the ability to talk to each other during a crisis, only 21 percent overall showed \"the seamless use\" of equipment needed to also communicate with state and federal officials.\nThe report's highest ratings went to the Washington, D.C., area; San Diego; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Columbus, Ohio; Sioux Falls, S.D.; and Laramie County, Wyo.\nThe lowest scores went to Chicago; Cleveland; Baton Rouge, La.; Mandan, N.D.; and American Samoa. The report includes large and small cities and their suburbs, along with U.S. territories.\nIn an overview, the report says all 75 areas surveyed have policies in place for helping their emergency workers communicate. But it also finds that \"formalized governance (leadership and planning) across regions has lagged.\"\nThe study is likely to add fuel to what looms as a battle in Congress this year. Democrats who take over the majority this week have promised to try fixing the problem emergency agencies have communicating with each other but have not said specifically what they will do, how much it will cost or how they will pay for it.\n\"Five years after 9/11, we continue to turn a deaf ear to gaps in interoperable communications,\" \u2014 the term used for emergency agencies' abilities to talk to each other, said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. \"If it didn't have such potentially devastating consequences, it would be laughable.\"\nThe attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, revealed major problems in how well emergency agencies were able to talk to each other during a catastrophe.
