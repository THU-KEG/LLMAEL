{"context_left": "Report :", "mention": "South Africa", "context_right": "n truth panel to condemn ANC  A panel probing apartheid - era abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights violations , including torture and bomb attacks , the state broadcaster said Monday .  The ANC , which led the struggle against white rule and now is in power , previously has acknowledged it was told to expect implication in right violations .  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday .  The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era 's abuses on white governments and their brutal security services .  South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked a \" preliminary document '' which condemns the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid .  An ANC spokesman , Thabo Masebe , said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance \" informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights violations . ''  Commission officials could not immediately be reached for comment .  The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners earlier this month .  The panel refused , to avoid appearing embarrassed .  The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the planting of land mines on border farms , abuses at its military camps in Angola and bombings .
