{"context_left": "Stocks end back-and-forth day slightly higher", "mention": "NEW YORK", "context_right": "-- Stocks finished an erratic session mixed Tuesday as higher commodity prices lifted energy and materials shares .  Major stock indexes had their third straight advance , reaching new 13-month highs , but there were more declining shares than advancers on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market .  Stocks had zigzagged for much of the day on mixed news from retailers and industrial production .  A rebound in the dollar after three down days kept investors ' appetite for stocks in check .  An eight-month weakening of the dollar has been lifting commodities prices and shares of U.S. exporters , which benefit from stronger foreign demand for their goods when the dollar falls .  Record-low U.S. interest rates have also driven investors to seek higher returns in stocks and commodities , lifting share prices .

Ford was laid to rest on the grounds of his presidential museum Wednesday after eight days of mourning and remembrance that spanned the country , from the California desert to the nation 's capital and back to Ford 's boyhood home .  The sunset burial capped the official mourning for the 38th president after a 17-hour viewing Tuesday night and Wednesday at the museum in his hometown .  At a graveside service that included a 21-gun salute and a 21-aircraft flyover , Vice President Dick Cheney presented former first lady Betty Ford with the American flag that was draped over her husband 's casket .  Earlier , Ford was remembered as a man not afraid to laugh , make tough decisions or listen to the advice of his independent wife in eulogies delivered during a funeral at the church the couple attended for six decades .  An honor guard carried the casket inside Grace Episcopal Church , where Ford 's defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , and Ford 's successor , Jimmy Carter , recalled his public service .  Rumsfeld : ' He was one of us ' His widow wiped away tears as she sat with the couple 's four children and more than 300 dignitaries and family friends , including golfing legend Jack Nicklaus . \"  He was one of us , \" Rumsfeld said , \" And that made him special and needed in a dark and dangerous hour for our nation . \"  Rumsfeld , who recently left his post as President Bush 's defense secretary , remembered Ford as a courageous and steady leader who healed the nation after Watergate .  Rumsfeld said the Navy is considering naming a new aircraft carrier after Ford , a Navy veteran .  A decision is expected later this month . \"  How fitting it would be that the name Gerald R. Ford will patrol the high seas for decades to come in defense of the nation he loved so much , \" he said .  Carter described the close personal friendship he and Ford developed over the years . \"  I relished his sound advice , \" Carter said as his wife , Rosalynn , cried . \"  I want to thank my predecessor for all he did to heal our land . \"  Thousands of flag-waving mourners lined the roads under sunny skies as the motorcade bearing Ford 's casket traveled between his presidential museum in downtown Grand Rapids to the church , before returning to the museum .  Viewing period extended  The viewing had to be extended Wednesday until nearly noon so everyone in line could pay their respects .  Some 57,000 mourners waited hours to file past the flag-draped casket during the night .  Some stopped and made silent prayers . \"  We 're here to honor him , \" said Philip Bareham of Lansing , who was the last person to view the casket and whose parents were among Ford 's earliest supporters and political allies . \"  We just love this family .  They are so down to earth . \"  Ford represented Grand Rapids in Congress for 25 years .  His family had belonged to Grace Episcopal Church since the early 1940s .  Richard Norton Smith , an author , presidential historian and former director of Ford 's museum and library , reminded mourners how important Ford 's hometown was to him . \"  Grand Rapids returned his affection many times over , \" which was \" unforgettably demonstrated by the tens of thousands who stood in line for hours outside the museum , braving the cold to assure that his last night was anything but lonely , \" Smith said .  Draped over the back of one pew at the funeral was a blue blanket with the letter \" M \" emblazoned on it , symbolizing Ford 's alma mater , the University of Michigan , where he played football for national championship teams in 1932 and 1933 .  Many of the mourners at the museum and lining the roads during his funeral procession on Wednesday wore Michigan hats and sweat shirts in his honor .

{"context_left": "", "mention": "Home Depot", "context_right": "CEO Nardelli quits  Home-improvement retailer 's chief executive had been criticized over pay  ATLANTA - Bob Nardelli said he had no intention of stepping down .  His board said it did n't want anybody else .  But in the end , analysts said , the criticism over Nardelli 's hefty pay and The Home Depot Inc. 's poor stock performance forced a change of heart .  Nardelli abruptly resigned as chairman and chief executive of the world 's largest home improvement store chain after six years at the helm , the company said Wednesday .  He did n't leave empty-handed : the Atlanta - based company said Nardelli would receive a severance package worth roughly $ 210 million , an amount decried by some lawmakers as a golden parachute that sends the wrong message to investors . \"  It 's a sign of being totally out of touch , \" said Rep. Barney Frank , D-Mass. , the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee . \"  They do n't understand the extent to which they make the American public angry . \"  Frank said he would push for legislation requiring public companies to allow shareholders to have a say in compensation and severance for senior executives .  At Home Depot 's annual meeting last May , shareholder proposals to give investors a say on the CEO 's pay and to restrict retirement benefits for senior executives were rejected .  Nardelli 's severance package includes a cash payment of $ 20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $ 77 million .  A Home Depot spokesman said the timing of the resignation , which was effective Tuesday , had no bearing on the amount in the package .  The total package is seven times the $ 30 million Home Depot set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service .  Home Depot has 2,127 stores and 355,000 employees in the United States , Canada , Mexico and China .  Home Depot said Nardelli was being replaced by Frank Blake , its vice chairman , effective immediately .  Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus , who had a hand in hiring Nardelli , said he supports the board 's decision to replace Nardelli with Blake . \"  My concern is what happens in the future , and I feel very good about it , \" said Marcus , who no longer works for Home Depot in any official capacity but remains one of the company 's largest individual shareholders .  Asked about the severance payout , Marcus said the amount wo n't be that big a deal in the long-run if the company 's stock price improves . \"  It 's like the old story , if the stock goes up 10 points , who 's going to care ? \"  Marcus said .  Nardelli , a former college football player , became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at General Electric Co. , where Nardelli had been a senior executive .  Blake 's appointment is permanent , Home Depot spokesman Jerry Shields said .  The company declined to make Blake available for comment , and messages left for Nardelli with his secretary and on his wife 's cell phone were not immediately returned .  Home Depot shares rose 91 cents , or 2.3 percent , to close at $ 41.07 on the New York Stock Exchange , near the upper end of their 52-week range of $ 32.85 to $ 43.95 .  Before Wednesday 's news , Home Depot 's stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over .  Nardelli 's sudden departure was stunning in that he told The Associated Press as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving , and a key director said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors .  That director , Bonnie Hill , did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in Los Angeles .  Asked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot , Nardelli said unequivocally that he had n't .  Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now , Nardelli said , \" Selling hammers . \"  For The Home Depot ? \"  Absolutely , \" he said at the time .  Marcus said he had no idea Nardelli 's resignation was coming . \"  Obviously , something happened over this last period of time that changed their mind and Nardelli 's mind about staying , \" Marcus said .  Home Depot said Nardelli 's decision to resign was by mutual agreement with Home Depot . \"  We are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of The Home Depot over the past six years , \" Home Depot 's board said in a statement .  Nardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader .  He helped increase revenue and profits at Home Depot and increase the number of stores the company operates .

Barney Frank , D-Mass. , the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee . \"  They do n't understand the extent to which they make the American public angry . \"  Frank said he would push for legislation requiring public companies to allow shareholders to have a say in compensation and severance for senior executives .  At", "mention": "Home Depot", "context_right": "'s annual meeting last May , shareholder proposals to give investors a say on the CEO 's pay and to restrict retirement benefits for senior executives were rejected .  Nardelli 's severance package includes a cash payment of $ 20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $ 77 million .  A Home Depot spokesman said the timing of the resignation , which was effective Tuesday , had no bearing on the amount in the package .  The total package is seven times the $ 30 million Home Depot set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service .  Home Depot has 2,127 stores and 355,000 employees in the United States , Canada , Mexico and China .  Home Depot said Nardelli was being replaced by Frank Blake , its vice chairman , effective immediately .  Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus , who had a hand in hiring Nardelli , said he supports the board 's decision to replace Nardelli with Blake . \"  My concern is what happens in the future , and I feel very good about it , \" said Marcus , who no longer works for Home Depot in any official capacity but remains one of the company 's largest individual shareholders .  Asked about the severance payout , Marcus said the amount wo n't be that big a deal in the long-run if the company 's stock price improves . \"  It 's like the old story , if the stock goes up 10 points , who 's going to care ? \"  Marcus said .  Nardelli , a former college football player , became CEO of Home Depot in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at General Electric Co. , where Nardelli had been a senior executive .  Blake 's appointment is permanent , Home Depot spokesman Jerry Shields said .  The company declined to make Blake available for comment , and messages left for Nardelli with his secretary and on his wife 's cell phone were not immediately returned .  Home Depot shares rose 91 cents , or 2.3 percent , to close at $ 41.07 on the New York Stock Exchange , near the upper end of their 52-week range of $ 32.85 to $ 43.95 .  Before Wednesday 's news , Home Depot 's stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over .  Nardelli 's sudden departure was stunning in that he told The Associated Press as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving , and a key director said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors .  That director , Bonnie Hill , did not immediately return messages left Wednesday for her at her office in Los Angeles .  Asked in the earlier AP interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot , Nardelli said unequivocally that he had n't .  Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now , Nardelli said , \" Selling hammers . \"  For The Home Depot ? \"  Absolutely , \" he said at the time .  Marcus said he had no idea Nardelli 's resignation was coming . \"  Obviously , something happened over this last period of time that changed their mind and Nardelli 's mind about staying , \" Marcus said .  Home Depot said Nardelli 's decision to resign was by mutual agreement with Home Depot . \"  We are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of The Home Depot over the past six years , \" Home Depot 's board said in a statement .  Nardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader .  He helped increase revenue and profits at Home Depot and increase the number of stores the company operates .  Home Depot 's earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years .  But the public discussion about his pay and the company 's stock price became a distraction .  As of the end of 2005 , Nardelli had earned $ 123.7 million in compensation excluding certain stock option grants since becoming CEO .  His compensation for 2006 has not yet been disclosed .

He did n't leave empty-handed : the Atlanta - based company said Nardelli would receive a severance package worth roughly $ 210 million , an amount decried by some lawmakers as a golden parachute that sends the wrong message to investors . \"  It 's a sign of being totally out of touch , \" said Rep.

Nardelli 's severance package includes a cash payment of $ 20 million and the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at roughly $ 77 million .  A Home Depot spokesman said the timing of the resignation , which was effective Tuesday , had no bearing on the amount in the package .  The total package is seven times the $ 30 million Home Depot set aside last June for stores and employees that provide good customer service .

{"context_left": "Health insurance bridges gap for poor families  Free medical care can help children get out of poverty , official says", "mention": "BIRMINGHAM", "context_right": ", Ala. - For years , Al Rohling watched parents quit their jobs when their kids got sick , deliberately making their incomes drop to a point where they could get U.S. government medical help .  Rohling , who directed Alabama 's housing authority at the time , reached a startling conclusion : If children could drive parents into hardship when they became ill , could medical insurance help parents rediscover financial health ? \"  Health care for children really is a bridge to get out of poverty , \" said Rohling .  Rohling quit his job in 1988 to help set up the Child Caring Foundation , which provides free health insurance for children through the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health care provider .  The foundation is just one example of a charity that bridges the gap between Medicaid -- subsidized insurance -- for the poorest and private health insurance paid for either privately for those who can afford it , or by an employer .  That gap leaves up to 9 million U.S. children uninsured in the United States , a nation with no universal health care .  Many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children . \"  The problem of the uninsured is getting worse , \" and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004 , said Jennifer Tolbert , principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured , a Washington - based think tank .  Tolbert said it was possible the U.S. Congress could increase the scope of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year .  In the lurch  Children with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness , while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost .

Va .  - One year ago Tuesday , the nation was holding its breath for 13 miners who were trapped deep inside the Sago Mine near Buckhannon , W. Va .  As it turned out , 12 of the 13 miners never made it out alive .  In West Virginia Tuesday , Randal McCloy , the lone survivor of the disaster , joined the families of the 12 men who died -- to remember them and the nightmare that began one year ago . \"  I 'm just sick when I think -- every day when I think how those men had to die and it makes me sick , \" says Debbie Hamner whose husband died in the mine .  Since Sago , both West Virginia and the federal government have passed new mine safety laws .  But in the mines themselves , little has changed .  \u2022 There 's still no better way to communicate with miners below ground ;  \u2022 Wireless communications wo n't be required until 2009 ;  \u2022 Electronic tracking systems for miners are still on the drawing board ;  \u2022 Underground emergency safe rooms are still not required by law ; and  \u2022 Mines have another year to position more rescue teams .  Davitt McAteer is a mine safety expert who once ran the government 's Mine Safety and Health Administration and led West Virginia 's Sago Mine investigation . \"  We need to have a way to communicate with trapped miners , \" McAteer says . \"  We need to protect trapped miners until we can get to them , and we need to have a way that we can provide them with the breathing apparatus and the air system so they can stay alive . \"  What has changed in mine safety since the Sago tragedy :  \u2022 Improved emergency procedures and training is now required ;  \u2022 There are more federal mine inspectors and tougher fines for safety violations ; and  \u2022 Mines must now notify the federal government within 15 minutes of an accident .  Still not required , though are underground emergency safe rooms .  The union representing many of the nation 's 73,000 coal miners says it 's a sign of priorities . \"  There 's still just an attitude out there that production comes first and safety is a convenient thing and it comes second , \" says Dennis O'Dell of United Mine Workers of America .  These are boom times for the coal industry , producing a record 1.17 billion tons of coal in 2006 , but also the highest death toll in 11 years .", "query_id": "1644234:0", "label_id": 3434750, "Wikipedia_ID": 3434750, "Wikipedia_URL": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "Wikipedia_title": "United States"}

{"context_left": "", "mention": "Riley", "context_right": "to have surgery on right knee  MIAMI - Pat Riley is taking a break from a season that has left him limping and in pain .  The Miami Heat coach began an indefinite leave of absence Wednesday because of hip and knee problems , choosing assistant Ron Rothstein to fill his spot on an interim basis .  Riley will have surgery Friday to remove floating chips in his right knee .  Surgery on his hip , the malady that hurts him most now , is not yet scheduled .  The 61-year-old coach does n't know how long he 'll be out . \"  I 'm going to be displaced for a while , but not disconnected at all , \" he said .  Miami 's record fell to 13-18 on Wednesday after a 110-95 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers .  Already this season , the Heat have seen Shaquille O'Neal , Dwyane Wade and Jason Williams -- perhaps the three biggest keys in last year 's championship run -- miss many games with injuries .  And now it 's Riley 's turn . \"  We have a championship team that is sideways right now , so this is going to be a great challenge , \" Riley said . \"  Keep your notebooks open .  We 'll see how it plays out . \"  Riley , who also is the Heat president , resigned as coach shortly before the 2003-04 season , then returned to the bench in December 2005 , replacing Stan Van Gundy and postponing right hip replacement surgery .  In September , after deciding against having offseason surgery , Riley said he did n't expect to need the operation this season , but the pain has apparently worsened in recent weeks . \"  I 'm just tired of the pain and the medication , \" Riley said .  Riley was asked if the knee injury , or at its severity , stems in any way from him reportedly kicking a locker room door last week following a loss in Chicago . \"  What I do in the locker room really has always been my business , \" Riley said .  Heat center Alonzo Mourning said he did n't know if the kick made Riley 's condition worse . \"  Typical Riles , \" Mourning said . \"  All the years that he 's coached me I 've seen him tear a lot of things up . \"  Rothstein was the Heat 's first head coach in the 1988-89 season and lasted three years with the expansion franchise , finishing with a 57-189 record .  His last full stint as an NBA head coach was with the 1992-93 Detroit Pistons , a team he guided to a 40-42 record , and he filled in for Riley for the final two games of last season while the coach visited his ailing mother . \"  Listen , I have n't been in the first chair in an NBA game since 1993 , \" said Rothstein , who also coached the WNBA 's Miami Sol for three seasons . \"  Coaching the WNBA was a totally different story .  I do n't mean to demean that at all .  But this is different .  So , I 'm sort of curious to see how I 'll feel and how I 'll handle it . \"  Riley 's frustration has grown as the Heat have struggled this season , remaining mired below .500 .  Plus , on Wednesday he deactivated forwards Antoine Walker and James Posey because neither met a Jan. 1 deadline for a team conditioning goal regarding body fat .  But he said Wednesday the team 's record did not factor into his decision to temporarily step aside now . \"  We 've had defensive lapses that are mind-boggling to me , \" Riley said . \"  The offensive output will be corrected when Shaq and Dwyane and everybody 's healthy .  I do n't think there 's been any question about that .  But I have n't been happy with our overall effort and defense all year long . \"  The Heat have n't had their preseason projected starting five together for any games yet this season because of all the injuries . \"  We 're all frustrated that we 're not doing as well as we 're supposed to be doing , \" O'Neal said . \"  But there 's a lot of iffy factors involved with that .  Very soon , everybody will be back .  That 'll be the day we 're looking forward to . \"  Wade , last season 's finals MVP , was expected to miss his third straight game Wednesday because of a sprained wrist .  A six-game Western swing begins Friday in Phoenix and the team hopes to get O'Neal back by the end of the trip . \"  I have n't been happy about the situation , \" Riley said . \"  I do n't think anybody is .  I hope that when everybody gets healthy , including myself , it 'll rectify itself . \"  Riley has a career record of 1,164-607 , including Wednesday 's loss , which counts against him .  Last season 's title run was vindication for Riley , who made sweeping roster changes after the 2005 playoffs .  The championship was Riley 's seventh and his fifth as a head coach , but his first since 1988 with the Showtime-era Los Angeles Lakers .  Other marquee coaches have dealt with similar issues .  Larry Brown missed 17 games with the Pistons two seasons ago following hip surgery , and Lakers coach Phil Jackson missed about a month before this season after his hip was replaced .  But , Riley cracks , that 's no indication of how long he 'll be out . \"  I 'm tougher than those guys , \" he said .", "query_id": "1645520:0", "label_id": 352045, "Wikipedia_ID": 352045, "Wikipedia_URL": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "Wikipedia_title": "Pat Riley"}

Riley will have surgery Friday to remove floating chips in his right knee .  Surgery on his hip , the malady that hurts him most now , is not yet scheduled .  The 61-year-old coach does n't know how long he 'll be out . \"  I 'm going to be displaced for a while , but not disconnected at all , \" he said .

{"context_left": "Riley to have surgery on right knee  MIAMI - Pat Riley is taking a break from a season that has left him limping and in pain .  The Miami Heat coach began an indefinite leave of absence Wednesday because of hip and knee problems , choosing assistant Ron Rothstein to fill his spot on an interim basis .  Riley will have surgery Friday to remove floating chips in his right knee .  Surgery on his hip , the malady that hurts him most now , is not yet scheduled .  The 61-year-old coach does n't know how long he 'll be out . \"  I 'm going to be displaced for a while , but not disconnected at all , \" he said .  Miami 's record fell to 13-18 on Wednesday after a 110-95 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers .  Already this season , the Heat have seen Shaquille O'Neal , Dwyane Wade and Jason Williams -- perhaps the three biggest keys in last year 's championship run -- miss many games with injuries .  And now it 's Riley 's turn . \"  We have a championship team that is sideways right now , so this is going to be a great challenge , \" Riley said . \"  Keep your notebooks open .  We 'll see how it plays out . \"  Riley , who also is the Heat president , resigned as coach shortly before the 2003-04 season , then returned to the bench in December 2005 , replacing Stan Van Gundy and postponing right hip replacement surgery .  In September , after deciding against having offseason surgery , Riley said he did n't expect to need the operation this season , but the pain has apparently worsened in recent weeks . \"  I 'm just tired of the pain and the medication , \" Riley said .  Riley was asked if the knee injury , or at its severity , stems in any way from him reportedly kicking a locker room door last week following a loss in Chicago . \"  What I do in the locker room really has always been my business , \" Riley said .  Heat center Alonzo Mourning said he did n't know if the kick made Riley 's condition worse . \"  Typical Riles , \" Mourning said . \"  All the years that he 's coached me I 've seen him tear a lot of things up . \"  Rothstein was the Heat 's first head coach in the 1988-89 season and lasted three years with the expansion franchise , finishing with a 57-189 record .  His last full stint as an NBA head coach was with the 1992-93 Detroit Pistons , a team he guided to a 40-42 record , and he filled in for Riley for the final two games of last season while the coach visited his ailing mother . \"  Listen , I have n't been in the first chair in an NBA game since 1993 , \" said Rothstein , who also coached the WNBA 's Miami Sol for three seasons . \"  Coaching the WNBA was a totally different story .  I do n't mean to demean that at all .  But this is different .  So , I 'm sort of curious to see how I 'll feel and how I 'll handle it . \"  Riley 's frustration has grown as the Heat have struggled this season , remaining mired below .500 .  Plus , on Wednesday he deactivated forwards Antoine Walker and James Posey because neither met a Jan. 1 deadline for a team conditioning goal regarding body fat .  But he said Wednesday the team 's record did not factor into his decision to temporarily step aside now . \"  We 've had defensive lapses that are mind-boggling to me , \" Riley said . \"  The offensive output will be corrected when Shaq and Dwyane and everybody 's healthy .  I do n't think there 's been any question about that .  But I have n't been happy with our overall effort and defense all year long . \"  The Heat have n't had their preseason projected starting five together for any games yet this season because of all the injuries . \"  We 're all frustrated that we 're not doing as well as we 're supposed to be doing , \" O'Neal said . \"  But there 's a lot of iffy factors involved with that .  Very soon , everybody will be back .  That 'll be the day we 're looking forward to . \"  Wade , last season 's finals MVP , was expected to miss his third straight game Wednesday because of a sprained wrist .  A six-game Western swing begins Friday in Phoenix and the team hopes to get O'Neal back by the end of the trip . \"  I have n't been happy about the situation , \" Riley said . \"  I do n't think anybody is .  I hope that when everybody gets healthy , including myself , it 'll rectify itself . \"  Riley has a career record of 1,164-607 , including Wednesday 's loss , which counts against him .

{"context_left": "", "mention": "Chertoff", "context_right": "pledges to address communications  Homeland security secretary acknowledges friction has hindered progress  WASHINGTON - The nation 's homeland security chief pledged Wednesday that 75 metropolitan areas would have advanced disaster communications systems by 2009 but acknowledged that friction among emergency agencies continues to hinder progress . \"  We are determined to get this job done in the next two years , \" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said at a news briefing .  He did not say how much the effort would cost , but so far the government has distributed more than $ 2.9 billion to communities around the country with mixed results .  Democrats who will control Congress this year have also promised to make communications upgrades a priority , but have provided little detail .  Chertoff released a survey of how well the 75 U.S. communities have prepared their first responders to communicate during a catastrophe .  More than five years after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , exposed severe weaknesses in the ability of emergency workers to communicate with each other , the report gave only six of the areas studied the highest grades .  Portions of the report had been obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press . '  Longstanding cultural differences ' Chertoff said Wednesday that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , agencies have tried to overcome old turf rivalries that can hamper emergency work . \"  In some communities , not all , there are some longstanding cultural differences between different kinds of responders , \" including police , firefighters and medical personnel , Chertoff said . \"  I think that is a challenge and that culture has been a challenge . \"  The report found that while emergency agencies in more than 60 percent of the communities studied had the ability to talk to each other during a crisis , only 21 percent overall showed \" the seamless use \" of equipment needed to also communicate with state and federal officials .  The report 's highest ratings went to the Washington , D.C. , area ; San Diego ; Minneapolis-St . Paul ; Columbus , Ohio ; Sioux Falls , S.D. ; and Laramie County , Wyo.  The lowest scores went to Chicago ; Cleveland ; Baton Rouge , La. ; Mandan , N.D. ; and American Samoa .  The report includes large and small cities and their suburbs , along with U.S. territories .  In an overview , the report says all 75 areas surveyed have policies in place for helping their emergency workers communicate .  But it also finds that \" formalized governance ( leadership and planning ) across regions has lagged . \"  The study is likely to add fuel to what looms as a battle in Congress this year .  Democrats who take over the majority this week have promised to try fixing the problem emergency agencies have communicating with each other but have not said specifically what they will do , how much it will cost or how they will pay for it . \"  Five years after 9/11 , we continue to turn a deaf ear to gaps in interoperable communications , \" -- the term used for emergency agencies ' abilities to talk to each other , said Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. \" If it did n't have such potentially devastating consequences , it would be laughable . \"  The attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , revealed major problems in how well emergency agencies were able to talk to each other during a catastrophe .  Many firefighters climbing the World Trade Center towers died when they were unable to hear police radio warnings to leave the crumbling buildings .  The report says first responders in New York now have well-established systems to communicate with each other -- but not the best , most advanced possible .  Thirteen U.S. cities score better than New York .  Judged in three categories  Communities were judged in three categories : operating procedures in place , use of communications systems and how effectively local governments have coordinated in preparation for a disaster .  Most of the areas surveyed included cities and their surrounding communities , based on the assumption that in a major crisis emergency personnel from all local jurisdictions would respond .  The areas with the six best scores were judged advanced in all three categories .  The cities with the lowest grades had reached the early implementation stage for only one category , and intermediate grades in the other two categories .

No ideologues , please  There was a time when President George W. Bush 's ideological certitude was politically appealing and perhaps functionally necessary .  That time has long since passed .  The country is tired , even fearful , of leaders with fervent beliefs that seem impervious to new ( or even old ) facts .  Voters see the war in Iraq as an \" idea , \" not a solution -- and Americans do not like ideas that do not work .  Voters likely will view Bush 's \" surge \" of troops into Iraq as new evidence of failure , and the dangers of a leader who depends on preconceived ideas .  Serious student  Presidential elections are a never-ending series of mid-course corrections .  Voters look to compensate for the leadership weaknesses of the incumbent .  An example comes from the life and career of Gerald Ford .  In 1976 , voters wanted a pure antidote to Richard Nixon 's paranoid megalomania .  Once Ford pardoned Nixon , he could not be that candidate .  Instead , Americans chose Jimmy Carter , a peanut farmer who had never worked in Washington , and who promised never to lie to the American people .  The counterpoint thinking continues .  Voters in 2008 are going to want someone who prides himself ( or herself ) on spending time in the library -- who has a hands-on curiosity about the details .  Washington experience not necessary  Voters these days not only do not value Washington experience -- or any office-holding experience -- it can make them suspicious .

Others sprinkled it on their dry clothes . \"  It was a long-cherished desire to take a dip here during the Kumbh Mela , \" said Naba Kumar Ghosh , a young school teacher from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal . \"  The experience has been one of fulfillment , a complete cleansing of the inner self . \"  Shakuntala , a 70-year-old woman who gave only one name , said she traveled all night from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to bathe in the Ganges , just as she has done at every Kumbh Mela over the last 25 years . \"  It was a divine experience , a dip in the holy waters is like being with God , \" she said . \"  God willing , I will be here for the next ' Kumbh ' too \" .  Rama Devi , an old woman from Allahabad who could not remember her age , has not missed a single Kumbh and was determined to make it this time despite her inability to walk .

Garuda 's flight lasted 12 divine days , or 12 years of mortal time , hence the celebration of \" Maha Kumbh Mela \" every 12 years .  The midway point between two such celebrations is also considered highly favorable because the position of the sun and the moon are the same as during the \" Maha Kumbh \" .

Make YOURSELF a priority  * Shop for healthy foods your body needs  * Get enough sleep  * Exercise regularly  2 .  Know your numbers  Ring in the New Year with a pledge to visit your doctor and learn your blood pressure reading and fasting cholesterol , triglyceride and blood sugar levels .

Up your ante !  Antioxidants are naturally occurring compounds found in plant based foods .  Antioxidants help the body fight many serious conditions , including cancer and heart disease , by thwarting the action of harmful free radicals .  According to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , July 2006 , the following foods are among the richest in antioxidants .  Go out of your way to incorporate them into your daily diet .  1 .  Blackberries  2 .  Walnuts  3 .  Strawberries  4 .  Artichokes  5 .  Cranberries  6 .  Raspberries  7 .  Blueberries  8 .

Many consumers believe they 're buying the right type of bread but are often confused .  According to a Sara Lee Food & Beverage survey , 73 % of consumers who were asked what type of bread they had in the house said \" whole wheat bread , \" but after checking the label realized that they mistakenly thought \" enriched wheat \" meant whole grain .

Slow the pace - lose fat on your waist  In an interesting experiment that was presented at the 2006 Annual Scientific Meeting a NAASO , women were invited to eat a pasta lunch on two different days .  On one day , the women were given a small spoon and asked to take small bites , put the spoon down between bites , and chew each bite at least 15 times .  On the second day , the women were given a large spoon and asked to eat as quickly as possible without stopping between bites .  On both occasions , the women ate until they felt comfortably full .
