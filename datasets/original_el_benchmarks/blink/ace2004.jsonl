The incredibly close Florida vote count for President is in the state courts and heading for the US Supreme Court at the end of the week .  That 's virtually unprecedented , as the Federal Courts have tended to stay out of elections , which are the responsibility of the states .  Joe O'Grossman is a professor of constitutional law at Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins University .  He says that in this instance the Supreme Court probably felt the circumstances were such that they had no real alternative but to take the case .  Well , I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try to reject it out of hand .  In fact , I think that Lawrence Tribe , the Harvard Law School Professor who is arguing for Gore tomorrow , is going to ask the court to hold the case , moot and dismiss it .  And the Bush campaign has brought the case , but recognizes that the particular issues that they brought to the court last week are really not very relevant anymore .  They are going to probably , well , I know what they are going to do .  They are going to try to broaden the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election procedures .  So , they are looking for a coronation .  And the Gore people at this point just want to get rid of this case , because they think they have a better chance in the Florida courts .  Republicans generally support states ' rights .  So , does it appear somewhat ironic that they are going to the Supreme Court in this instance ?  No , I think first of all the notion that Republicans favor states ' rights and Democrats oppose it , is much too simplistic .  That 's generally true , but it 's only true on some issues .  And in this case , you could argue that the Bush people are going to the Supreme Court to preserve the right of Florida , to determine its own electors .  So , there is a kind of states ' rights issue there .  But they need , or at least they once thought they needed the Supreme Court to endorse it .  So it goes both ways .  What are the justices likely looking for ?  Well , I do n't know .  But I think that - and I think they will be divided , I mean I do n't think they will be unanimous .  Obviously , they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the case .  American election laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in the Federal courts , but this is certainly the first time we have had a Supreme Court challenge over presidential election .  So , there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least law that has n't been made yet .  It 's possible that if the court accepts the invitation of the Bush campaign , at least as it is expressed in the briefs they submitted yesterday , that the court will in the sense , take the entire issue , even - not just the specific questions that it was asked last week and try to resolve the question .  For example , if the court says it is clearly the fact that the legislature of the state of Florida can determine for itself who its electors will be , that will pretty much end the case , because that 's what the legislature already plans to do .  And that does n't mean the Gore people wo n't keep trying , because ultimately Congress has to decide and only Congress can decide if there are competing slates of electors submitted , which slate to accept .  The Johns Hopkins University constitutional law professor Joe O'Grossman says , it 's still not certain the Supreme Court will actually hear the Florida case .  As their first order , business Friday , attorneys for Vice President Gore will move to have the court dismiss the case brought by Republican George W Bush .", "query_id": "VOA20001129.2000.036:0", "label_id": 108956, "Wikipedia_ID": 108956, "Wikipedia_URL": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "Wikipedia_title": "Washington, D.C."}

Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867 . )  &QL; &UR; By DAVID FIRESTONE &LR; &QC; &QL; &UR; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service &LR; &QC; &QL;", "mention": "TALLAHASSEE", "context_right": ", Fla. _ Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday their only chance for victory in his contest of the Florida election would be shattered if they have to wait until Saturday to begin counting disputed ballots , and they began an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court to do the counting itself , immediately .  The appeal was filed with the District Court of Appeal late Wednesday afternoon , and will be submitted to the state 's highest court early Thursday , Gore 's lawyers said .  It essentially asks the Supreme Court to take over Gore 's contest lawsuit from the slow-moving trial court , to count the ballots itself , and eventually to declare Gore the winner if he wins the recount .  But lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush said they had no intention of allowing any hand counting to begin without a vigorous legal fight .  To that end , they persuaded Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls to order 1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties _ brought up from south Florida and placed in the court 's custody .  That represents 83 times the number of disputed ballots that the judge had agreed on Tuesday to transport to Tallahassee at the Gore team 's request .  And it could take weeks if not months to count them all , the point that Barry Richard , Bush 's chief trial lawyer here , said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be transported here .  `` We did it to make a point , '' Richard said in an interview .  `` If you recount any ballots , you have to recount all of them .  Now , we do n't think any ballots should be counted , because the manual recount of ballots is finished .  But in the event the court determines that some ballots should be counted , we wanted them here so they could all be counted . ''  Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots , Gore 's lawyers barely objected to the move , asking only that the disputed ballots that might contain hidden Gore votes be separated from the mass .  `` I know when it 's futile , '' said David Boies , Gore 's chief trial lawyer , to Sauls .  Nonetheless , Gore 's lawyers were furious at the move , aware that it represents yet another enormous barrier to their hopes for an immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties and a quick decision from the judge that Gore really won the election .  Even if the Florida Supreme Court should swiftly agree to their request and orders the counting to begin by Friday , that would still put them three days behind their original timetable .

Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL; CHATTANOOGA , Tenn. _ Nearly 17 months after he first issued his call for a `` fresh start after a season of cynicism , '' Gov. George W. Bush ended his quest for the presidency Monday on a nearly identical note , pledging to purge Washington of what he cast as a crippling discord .  The course that Bush charted over his final hours on the campaign trail , plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw electoral arithmetic , left no doubt about where he placed the blame for that atmosphere .  His first major rally was in Tennessee and his last was planned for Arkansas , the home states , respectively , of Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton .  The Texas governor 's words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country 's best hope for bridging ideological divides , healing partisan wounds and making sure that Americans could gaze upon the White House with unfettered respect .  `` There 's a better day ahead if we have a leader who 's willing to unite the country , to bring people together , to elevate the people 's business above everyday politics , '' Bush said at a rally inside a hangar at the airport here , where supporters ' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision .  `` One more day ! ''  they roared .  `` One more day ! ''  What the nation needed , Bush told them , was `` a president who can unite this nation , a president who puts aside the endless partisan bickering that seems to gridlock our nation 's capitol , a president who puts the people first , a president who lifts this nation 's spirits .  `` I 'll be that president , '' he added , a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction .  It underscored the optimism that Bush has , from the very beginning , sought to project to voters .  His schedule over the course of a 16-hour day was also an expression of that confidence .  In between Tennessee and Arkansas , his campaign plane touched down in Wisconsin and Iowa , and while any one of those four states could wind up providing the key to a Bush victory , none have as many electoral votes as such battlegrounds as Michigan and Pennsylvania .  But they are genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be much more hospitable to Gore .  By visiting them Monday , Bush emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising vulnerability of the vice president .  He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him from the important business of beseeching supporters to grant him victory .  With just 24 hours before Election Day , Bush in many ways stripped campaigning to its essence : coaxing and cajoling , pleading and persuading .  `` I want you to understand that I ca n't win without you , '' Bush told a crowd of more than 1,000 people at a convention center in Green Bay , Wis. `` I hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get out to the polls . ''  Minutes later , he added : `` When you go out there and tell the folks where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done , and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the American people , I believe it does n't matter what political party they 're in .  They 're going to come our way . ''  In Chattanooga , Bush repeatedly needled Gore , which was much of the point of going to Tennessee , where Gore is not at all certain to prevail on Tuesday .

Around five thousand Palestinians form the Albus Camp near Souer ( 83 km south of Beirut ) gathered and followed a march by children dressed in military clothing who held stones and raised pictures of Mohamed al-Dura , the 12-year-old Palestinian child killed by Israeli army bullets in the Palestinian Territories in early October .

Aixing Dan , director of the International Co-operation Department of the Electric Power Industry Ministry , on this matter , expressed to Xinhua News Agency reporters today that if this power plant is successful , it will be a model for similar plants to be built along coastal regions .  Coal , water , oil , etc. , are normally used for traditional electricity generation .  However , using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost , is beneficial to the environment , etc. .  According to presentations , with this type of electricity generation method , a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade .  This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity .  Because of the efficiency of this construction method , the electricity generated is relatively competitive in price .  At the same time , using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions .  The Weir Group , whose headquarters is in the US , is a large , specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity generation .  The installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts .  Through the contact of the Yizhong Company of the US , the Weir Group and the Jiangsu Electric Power Department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity generation plant .  This power plant , which will be situated in Rudong , Jiangsu , has an annual generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts .  The investment amount is 2.4 billion US dollars .  The Chinese side holds 30 % of the shares while the Weir Group holds 70 % .  According to the agreement , the Weir Group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant .  Renzu Luo , managing director of the Weir Group , is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity generation along China 's coastal regions .  He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation .

According to presentations , with this type of electricity generation method , a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade .

The Chinese side holds 30 % of the shares while the Weir Group holds 70 % .  According to the agreement , the Weir Group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant .  Renzu Luo , managing director of the Weir Group , is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity generation along China 's coastal regions .

Two men have been killed , and a third has been injured since the hunting season opened on Nov. 15 .  All three accidents involved shotguns , elevated platforms and a practice relatively new to Michigan hunters _ shooting at deer from trees .  The Michigan season , one of the busiest , continues through Nov. 30 .  Firearm hunting from elevated platforms has long been legal in other states with heavy hunting , like New York and Pennsylvania .  But the practice is only in its third season in Michigan , and officials say it appears that hunters still have a lot to learn about safety .  Lt. Suzanne Koppelo , hunter safety administrator of the law enforcement division of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources &UR; , &LR; said that since firearm platform hunting began in Michigan there had been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice .  Three were fatal .  Two hunters shot themselves on platforms and another was killed on the ground by a hunter shooting from a platform .  `` If hunters exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of 20-some feet , it would be almost a nonissue , '' said Koppelo .  `` But given human nature , that 's not the case . ''  More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the Michigan woods this year , where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the state 's 1.9 million deer .  The numbers reinforce the need to improve education about platform hunting with firearms , Koppelo said .  The practice is more commonly associated with hunters using bows and arrows .  Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the woods , they wait quietly , typically at a height of 15 to 20 feet , and fire down at deer that wander below .  Despite the hunter killed from the platform , Sgt. Larry D. Sargent , hunter education field coordinator for the law enforcement division , says the practice does offer one safety advantage : errant shots typically thump harmlessly to the ground , rather than whistling through the woods and striking other people .  The problems primarily arise when hunters get in and out of position .  `` It 's kind of hard climbing a tree with a gun , '' Rob Williams said , as he and a hunting partner , Art Bush , waited on a recent morning in a conventional earthbound hunting blind about 20 miles west of Detroit .  For Williams , Rule No. 1 is not to climb a tree with a loaded gun .  He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a rope dangling from his belt to his gun , which he leaves unloaded on the ground .  When he is secure in his stand , he pulls his gun up after him and loads it .  Sargent says this is proper procedure .  One accident this year , however , illustrates the importance of following each step of the safety procedures .  A 16-year-old hunter used a haul line , but it was tied to the trigger guard and he left the gun loaded , Koppelo said .  The teen-ager 's gun went off and he was shot in the foot .  Others are hurt falling out of trees .  Koppelo said that state officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it was difficult , since they relied on hunters reporting minor accidents .  `` A lot of guys are embarrassed , '' Sargent said .  `` They 'll say they fell working in the yard or something . ''  Others , Koppelo says , do not want to report accidents for fear the law will be changed .  And she adds that though anecdotal reports show Michigan 's large hunting population to be taking slowly to firearm deer hunting from platforms , most expect the practice to catch on as it has in other states .

He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a rope dangling from his belt to his gun , which he leaves unloaded on the ground .  When he is secure in his stand , he pulls his gun up after him and loads it .  Sargent says this is proper procedure .  One accident this year , however , illustrates the importance of following each step of the safety procedures .  A 16-year-old hunter used a haul line , but it was tied to the trigger guard and he left the gun loaded , Koppelo said .  The teen-ager 's gun went off and he was shot in the foot .  Others are hurt falling out of trees .  Koppelo said that state officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it was difficult , since they relied on hunters reporting minor accidents .  `` A lot of guys are embarrassed , '' Sargent said .  `` They 'll say they fell working in the yard or something . ''  Others , Koppelo says , do not want to report accidents for fear the law will be changed .  And she adds that though anecdotal reports show Michigan 's large hunting population to be taking slowly to firearm deer hunting from platforms , most expect the practice to catch on as it has in other states .  As Peter Thompson , a 16-year-old hunter , said , `` Usually the deer do n't look up .

{"context_left": "MERGER &QL; By ALEX BERENSON &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; &LR; Back in January , when Internet stocks were hot , America Online agreed to buy Time Warner with AOL stock .  The deal , if approved by regulators , would leave AOL shareholders with 55 percent of the merged company , even though Time Warner 's revenue and cash flow are far greater .  Since then , AOL 's stock has fallen by almost a third , destroying most of the premium the company had offered for control of Time Warner .  So a Time Warner shareholder might conclude that America Online 's chairman , Stephen Case , had bamboozled his Time Warner counterpart , Gerald Levin , into taking AOL 's shares at the worst possible time .  `` Short term , anyone objective would say probably Steve got the better part of the deal , '' said Larry Haverty , a senior vice president at State Street Research in Boston and a longtime media investor .  But Haverty , like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry analysts , hardly cares .  With the merger likely to be completed later this month , he predicts that the merged company will grow quickly by combining AOL 's marketing skills and captive base of online users with Time Warner 's huge library of films , magazines and the like and its relationships with major advertisers .  `` The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the world , '' Haverty said .  `` Five years out , if you 're a shareholder in this company , you 're going to be a happy camper . ''  That view is widely shared .  `` Strategically , it makes a lot of sense , '' said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein .  `` These companies fill the holes of the other one .  They 're subscription-advertising combo models .  The reality is the pieces are very compatible . ''  To be sure , the recent history of big media mergers is hardly comforting for shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner .  Disney stumbled badly after it bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996 , and Time Warner stagnated for five years after it was created in 1990 by the merger of Time and Warner .  `` Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of uncertainty , '' said Roger McNamee of Integral Capital , which sold its 404,000 AOL shares the day the merger was announced .  But if the merged company can overcome that hurdle , it will have big advantages over Disney and other traditional media companies , which are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the Internet , said Jessica Reif of Merrill Lynch .  `` Given the multiple distribution platforms that they have , it 's obviously a very powerful consumer engine , '' Reif said .  `` There 's a reason that you see Disney and to a lesser extent NBC screaming in Washington . ''  John Schreiber , an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital , the mutual fund company that is Time Warner 's largest shareholder , with more than 120 million shares , said the companies had already begun to demonstrate how they would work together .  For example , AOL has pitched Time Warner 's magazines to its users , resulting in hundreds of thousands of new subscriptions .  And the companies are trying to sell big advertisers on deals that will reach both America Online users and the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read its magazines , Schreiber said .  `` Once the merger closes , I think you 'll see some very powerful cross-promotional deals across all of Time Warner 's advertisers , '' he said .  Schreiber also says the risk of cultural clashes between the companies is limited , because the companies disclosed publicly where top executives would stand in the combined company only a few weeks after the merger was announced .

{"context_left": "", "mention": "CAIRO", "context_right": ", Egypt ( AP ) _ In his foreign policy debut as Syria 's president , Bashar Assad met Sunday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in talks on Mideast peace and the escalating violence in the Palestinian territories .  Assad , on his first trip abroad since becoming president in July , also dealt with the issue of Iraq in the talks with Mubarak , Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said .  The Syrian leader 's visit came on a fourth day of clashes that have raged in the West Bank , Gaza Strip and Jerusalem , leaving more than two dozen Palestinians dead .  `` There is complete agreement ( between Mubarak and Assad ) as to the seriousness of the situation and that the negative repercussions would adversely effect the peace process , which is in itself in a very precarious state , '' Moussa said .  Assad , 35 , has focused on domestic issues since his father , Hafez Assad , died in June after 30 years in power .  He has taken steps to modernize his nation 's bureaucracy and revive its stagnant economy .  `` This was the first meeting of the first visit of President Bashar Assad after the funeral of his father , so it was only normal for the discussions to have a general tone ... in addition to certain specifics of special importance to both countries and the Arab world , '' Moussa said .  The late Syrian president rarely traveled abroad .  In his last few years , however , he had sent Bashar , educated as an eye doctor , on foreign trips as part of his grooming to become president .
