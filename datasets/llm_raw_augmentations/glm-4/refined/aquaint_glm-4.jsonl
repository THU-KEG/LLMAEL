{"id": 428, "llm_context": "Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu was the communist dictator who ruled Romania from 1965 until he was overthrown in a revolution in 1989. He implemented a series of policies that had a significant impact on the country, including its wildlife. As mentioned in the text, Ceau\u0219escu was an avid hunter and his influence on the hunting practices in Romania led to the feeding of meat to bear cubs in hunting reserves, which in turn caused some bears to develop a taste for meat. His regime was known for its repressive nature, and Ceau\u0219escu was eventually executed on December 25, 1989, after being found guilty of crimes against humanity."}
