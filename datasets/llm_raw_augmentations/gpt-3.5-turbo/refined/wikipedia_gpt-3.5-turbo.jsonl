This effect becomes more pronounced in the heavier elements due to the increasing nuclear charge and poor shielding of the d orbitals."}
{"id": 138, "llm_context": "The lanthanide contraction is a term used in chemistry to describe the decrease in atomic and ionic radii of the lanthanide elements (elements with atomic numbers 57-71) compared to the elements in the same period of the periodic table. This contraction is caused by the poor shielding of the nuclear charge by the 4f electrons, resulting in a stronger attraction between the outer valence electrons and the nucleus. This effect is similar to the d-block contraction described in the text, but it occurs in the lanthanide series rather than the d-block elements. The lanthanide contraction has important implications for the properties and reactivity of the lanthanide elements."}
